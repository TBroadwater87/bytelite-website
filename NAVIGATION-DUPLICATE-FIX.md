# ByteLite Navigation Duplicate Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Analysis

The perceived "duplicate navigation bars" were caused by **two separate header elements** with conflicting z-index positioning:

1. **Main Header** (`Header.astro`) - Actual navigation bar with z-index: 50
2. **Trust Bar** (`Hero.astro`) - Patent information overlay with z-index: 100

## Root Cause

The Trust Bar was positioned at `top: 0` with a higher z-index (100), causing it to overlap or appear as a duplicate navigation above the main header.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Trust Bar Positioning
- **Before**: `top: 0, z-index: 100`
- **After**: `top: 70px, z-index: 40`

### 2. Improved Visual Hierarchy
- Main Header: `z-index: 50` (stays on top)
- Trust Bar: `z-index: 40` (positioned below header)
- Trust Bar positioned 70px from top (below main navigation)

### 3. Enhanced Responsive Design
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .trust-bar {
    top: 60px; /* Smaller header on mobile */
    font-size: 0.75rem;
  }
  
  .hero {
    padding-top: 5rem; /* Adjusted spacing */
  }
}
```

### 4. Updated Hero Section Spacing
- Increased padding-top to 6rem (desktop) / 5rem (mobile)
- Accounts for both header and trust bar heights

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Hero.astro**
   - Fixed trust bar positioning
   - Added responsive breakpoints
   - Improved z-index hierarchy

## Testing Verification

✅ **Build completed successfully**
✅ **No duplicate header elements in generated HTML**
✅ **Proper visual hierarchy maintained**
✅ **Responsive design preserved**

## Result

- **Single navigation bar** now displays correctly
- **Trust bar** positioned below main navigation
- **No visual overlap** or duplication
- **Proper spacing** maintained across all screen sizes
- **All navigation functionality** preserved

The ByteLite website now has a clean, single navigation bar with the patent trust bar positioned appropriately below it.
