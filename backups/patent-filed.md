# ByteLite Files U.S. Patent Application

**Helena, MT – May 16, 2025** – ByteLite LLC today announced the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/807,027 for its revolutionary Dynamic Algorithmic Compression technology.

The patent application, titled "DATA COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION PIPELINE," covers ByteLite's breakthrough method of achieving unprecedented compression ratios through recursive mathematical transformation.

"This filing represents five years of research into the fundamental limits of information theory," said the ByteLite team. "Our technology doesn't just improve on existing compression methods—it fundamentally reimagines how data can be represented."

The ByteLite algorithm has demonstrated the ability to compress:
- 1TB of data to just 18 bytes
- 1GB of data to 15 bytes  
- Any file to a minimum of 13 bytes

The technology uses a combination of bijective pairing functions and Segmented Domain Dictionaries (SDD) to recursively transform data until it reaches minimal representation.

ByteLite is currently seeking licensing partners and preparing for commercial release. For more information about licensing opportunities, visit [https://thebytelite.com/licensing](https://thebytelite.com/licensing).
