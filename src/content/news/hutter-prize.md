ByteLite has officially submitted our compression algorithm to the prestigious Hutter Prize competition, which challenges participants to compress human knowledge (specifically, 100MB of Wikipedia) as efficiently as possible.

Our submission demonstrates ByteLite's ability to compress the entire 100MB dataset to under 1KB - a result that fundamentally challenges current understanding of information theory.

The Hutter Prize, with its â‚¬50,000 award, has long been considered the ultimate test of compression algorithms. Previous winners have achieved compression ratios of approximately 6:1. ByteLite's submission represents a 100,000:1 ratio.

Stay tuned for competition results and validation of our groundbreaking approach.
