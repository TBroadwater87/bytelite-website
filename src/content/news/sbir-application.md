ByteLite has submitted a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I application to explore government applications of our compression technology.

Potential applications include:
- Satellite communication bandwidth optimization
- Long-term data archival solutions
- Secure transmission of classified information
- Deep space communication protocols

The SBIR program could provide crucial funding to accelerate ByteLite's development and real-world deployment. Phase I funding would support feasibility studies and prototype development, with potential Phase II funding exceeding $1 million.

Our proposal highlights how ByteLite's compression could revolutionize data transmission for NASA's deep space missions, reducing transmission times from hours to seconds.
